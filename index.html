<h2>About this guide</h2>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Build tools are an essential part of modern computer programming. They bridge the gap between humans and computers, acting as translators between human- and computer-language. Compilers translate human-readable source code into assembly language. Assemblers translate assembly language into machine code. Linkers translate bits of machine code into larger executables. Makefiles tell the computer how to translate our source code. Debuggers translate machine code into human-readable text. With build tools, we can talk to the computer without speaking in ones and zeroes.<br /><br />We use build tools to speak in a way that comes naturally to us. They help us write code in a way that’s intuitive and comfortable to us, saving time and energy. They abstract unnecessary details, keeping us from dwelling on the complexities of the machine. Build tools can drastically increase our time- and energy-efficiency while programming.<br /><br />This guide will teach you about the most important build tools for C and C++ to increase your productivity, whether you’re a hobbyist or working at a Fortune 500 company. First, you’ll learn the basic concepts behind build tools and how to set them up. Then, we’ll dive into the details of compilers, Makefiles, CMake, and debuggers.
