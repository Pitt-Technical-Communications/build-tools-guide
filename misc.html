  <h2>Debuggers</h2>
  <p>Debuggers are essential tools for effective programming, especially in low-level languages like C and C++. Debugging tools help you figure out where bugs and issues are in your program with a lot of versatility. In this section, we'll be covering two prominent tools for command-line debugging: <i>GDB</i> and <i>Valgrind</i>.</p>
  <h2>GDB</h2>
  <p>GDB (from <i>GNU Debugger</i>) is the GNU toolchain's dedicated debugger. GDB is most useful for tracking the execution of a program. It uses a system called <i>ptrace</i> to trace the execution of code, allowing you to change a process's memory and register while it's running.</p>
  <p>To get started, examine the sample code below for a basic linked list that stores English words. It contains some structures along with a simple method called <code>new_ll</code> to create a new linked list. <code>main</code> calls <code>new_ll</code> and assigns its value to the <code>ll</code> variable.</p>
  <pre><code>typdef struct ll_node {
  struct ll_node* next;
  char* word;
} ll_node;

typedef struct linked_list {
  ll_node* head;
} word_list;

linked_list* new_ll() {
  linked_list* ll = malloc(sizeof(linked_list));
  if (ll = NULL) return NULL;
  ll->head = NULL;
  return ll;
}

int main() {
  linked_list* words = new_ll();
}</code></pre>
  <h3>Starting with GDB</h3>
  <p>Use the <code>-g</code> flag when compiling to tell the compiler to generate and retain debugging information in the executable. Then, open the executable with GDB and use the <code>r</code> command to run it.</p>
  <pre><samp>$ gcc ll.c -g -o ll
$ gdb ll
(gdb) r

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x000055555555517d in new_ll () at ll.c:16
16		ll->head = NULL;</samp></pre>
<p>The program reports a segmentation fault error at line 16, which occurs when a program tries to access memory that it doesn't have access to. As <code>ll->head</code> is the only memory the program tries to access in this line, it's likely that <code>ll</code> points to the wrong place.</p>
<h3>Basic Usage</h3>
<p>To find where the code goes wrong, use breakpoints to evaluate variables at during execution. Start by using the <code>l</code> command, for <code>list</code>, to view the line numbers of our code. <code>l</code> will display the next 10 lines, while <code>l -</code> will display the previous 10.</p>
<pre><samp>(gdb) l
11	} linked_list;
12
13	linked_list* new_ll() {
14		linked_list* ll = malloc(sizeof(linked_list));
15		if (ll = NULL) return NULL;
16		ll->head = NULL;
17		return ll;
18	}
19
20	int main() {
</samp></pre>
<p>Breakpoints suspend program execution before a line of code is run. Check that malloc successfully allocated memory for our linked list structure by placing a breakpoint on line 15 with the <code>b</code> command and printing the value of <code>ll</code> with the <code>p</code> command</code>.<p>
<pre><samp>(gdb) b 15
Breakpoint 1 at 0x555555555163: file ll.c, line 15.
(gdb) r
The program being debugged has been started already.
Start it from the beginning? (y or n) y

Breakpoint 1, new_ll () at ll.c:15
15		if (ll = NULL) return NULL;
(gdb) p ll
$1 = (linked_list *) 0x5555555592a0</samp></pre>
<p><code>ll</code> has the value <code>0x5555555592a0</code>, meaning that <code>malloc</code> successfully allocated memory. Otherwise, malloc would return <code>NULL</code>, represented by <code>0x0</code>. The segmentation fault occurred after the execution of line 16 so something must've gone wrong in the next few lines. Use the <code>n</code> command, for <code>next</code>, to go over code in the current stack frame line-by-line. <code>n</code> alone continues through the next line, while <code>n N</code> continues over the next N lines. Check the value of <code>ll</code> as you go.</p>
<pre><samp>(gdb) n
16		ll->head = NULL;
(gdb) p ll
$2 = (linked_list *) 0x0</samp></pre>
<p>After the execution of line 15, <code>ll</code> takes the value <code>0x0</code>, which is <code>NULL</code>. On line 15, the <code>if</code> statement's condition reads <code>ll = NULL</code> while it should read <code>ll == NULL</code>. Instead of checking whether <code>ll</code> is <code>NULL</code>, the program sets <code>ll</code> to <code>NULL</code> and returns <code>NULL</code> to the condition, which evaluates to false. When the program attempts to write to <code>ll->head</code> in the next line, a segmentation fault occurs. Set <code>ll</code> to its intended value with the <code>set</code> command and continue execution from there with the the <code>c</code> command.</p>
<pre><samp>(gdb) set ll=0x5555555592a0
(gdb) c
Continuing.
[Inferior 1 (process 213004) exited normally]</samp></pre>
<p>Now that you've found the bug, exit GDB with the <code>q</code> command. Fix the bug and then recompile. The code runs without issue.</p>

<h2>Valgrind</h2>
<p>Valgrind is a debugging tool specializing in memory debugging and detecting memory leaks. Valgrind acts as a virtual machine and none of the original program is run on the host machine. While this allows Valgrind to monitor memory very closely, it comes at substantial losses in performance. Valgrind's most used tool, <i>Memcheck</i>, keeps track of whether memory is valid and whether it is allocated after every instruction. Memcheck also includes its own implementation of C memory allocation that places memory guards and allows Memcheck to detect even very minor errors. In this section, we'll be focusing on using Memcheck to detect memory-related issues.</p>
<h3>Debugging with Memcheck</h3>
<p>Use the <code>-g</code> flag and <code>-O0</code> or <code>-O1</code> when compiling with GCC. The <code>-O</code> flags are optimizations flags, but using anything above <code>-O1</code> may cause Valgrind to produce phantom uninitialized value errors. We'll continue building on the linked list structure from the GDB section. After compiling, use Valgrind's <code>--leak-check=yes</code> option, which turns on the memory leak detector.</p>

$ valgrind --leak-check=yes ./ll

</samp></pre>
<p>Memcheck reports any errors and gives us a summary of any memory issues present. The <code>202439</code> on the left is the process ID, which is generally unimportant. The heap summary gives us information regarding allocation and frees on the heap. In our program, we <code>malloc</code> once for the <code>linked_list</code> structure, which is 8 bytes. As we never <code>free</code> that block of memory, Memcheck reports 8 bytes allocated in the heap and 8 bytes definitely lost. Memcheck also gives a stack trace of where and how the memory was allocated, noting a <code>malloc</code> in <code>new_ll (ll.c:16)</code>, which was called by <code>main (ll.c:21)</code>.</p>
<h3>Decoding Memcheck Error Messages</h3>
<table class="clean">
  <tr>
    <th width="180px">Message</th>
    <th>Explanation</th>
  </tr>
  <tr class="even">
    <td>Illegal Read/Write</td>
    <td>An illegal read or write occurs when your program reads or writes to an address in memory that it shouldn't. Memcheck cannot stop the memory access, but it will inform you directly before-hand. If the memory access would cause a segmentation fault, it still will.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="odd">
    <td>Use of Uninitialized Value</td>
    <td>When you try to read an uninitialized value, you have no way of knowing what data is in that spot in memory. If you <code>malloc</code> and immediately read from that spot, Memcheck will note that the values are allocated but uninitialized. It will complain once the unitialized data is being used in such a way that it would be externally visible.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="even">
    <td>Illegal Free</td>
    <td>When you try to <code>free</code> a memory block that has already been freed or you try to <code>free</code> in the middle of a block, Memcheck will complain about an illegal free. While an illegal <code>free</code> itself may not be harmful, it could be a sign of greater issues in a program.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="odd">
    <td>Mismatched Deallocation Function</td>
    <td>If you allocate a block of memory on the heap with <code>new</code>, it's important that you deallocate with <code>delete</code>. The same goes for <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code>, <code>new[]</code> and <code>delete[]</code>. While this generally has no effect on Linux machines, it could break your code on other operating systems.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="even">
    <td>Overlapping Source and Destination</td>
    <td>There are a few C standard library functions that copy some data (often strings) from one block of memory to another. If the blocks of memory overlap, Memcheck will detect this and notify you. While this may not be an issue in some copying implementations, it could break your code in some circumstances.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="odd">
    <td>Suspicious Argument Values</td>
    <td>Memcheck notifies you if the program allocates a block of memory with an abnormal size, such as a negative or unexplicably large number of bytes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="even">
    <td>Memory Leak</td>
    <td>With the <code>--leak-check==yes</code> option, Memcheck keeps track of all heap blocks that have been allocated and the pointers that point to those blocks. Memcheck then categorizes un-freed blocks by whether it believes they are <i>still reachable</i>, <i>definitely lost</i>, <i>indirectly lost</i>, or <i>possibly lost</i> based upon whether they are still pointed to.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="odd">
    <td>Uninitialized System Call Argument</td>
    <td>Memcheck checks the validity of any arguments when the program makes a system call. If the arguments are uninitialized or the arguments refer the system to an uninitialized buffer, Memcheck will report an error.</td>
  </tr>
