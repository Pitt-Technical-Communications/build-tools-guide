<h2>GNU Make</h2>
  <h3><b>What is <code>make</code>?</b></h3>
  <i>Make</i> is a utility that allows users to describe when and how to update files when other required files are changed. A common usage of <code>make</code> is to determine
   what parts of a large program must be recompiled and then to issue the necessary commands to do so. Since each file requires other files to be updated, <code>make</code> 
   lets you specify how those dependencies work, which eases the process of updating the files.

  <h3><b>What do makefiles consist of?</b></a></h3>
  There are five main elements inside a makefile.
  <ol>
    <li>Explicit Rules</li>
    <li>Implicit Rules</li>
    <li>Variable Definitions</li>
    <li>Directives</li>
    <li>Comments</li>
  </ol>

  <u>1. Explicit Rules</u><br>

  Explicit Rules take the following form: <br>
  <pre>
    <code>
    Target : Prerequisites<br>
            Recipe
    </code>
  </pre>

  Rules explain when a target is out of date and how to update the target if necessary. A target is out-of-date if one of two conditions have been met: The prerequisites
  for the target do not exist, or the prerequisites for the target have been modified more recently than the target. <br>
  <br>
  In this case, the given recipe will tell <code>make</code> how to update the target. Recipes primarily consist of commands that the shell will execute. Each line of the
  recipe must begin with a tab character. This can be changed through the .RECIPEPREFIX variable. <br>
  <br>
  An example rule is: <br>
  <pre>
    <code>
      foo.o : foo.c defs.h<br>
              cc -c -g foo.c
    </code>
  </pre>

  In this case, foo.o is the target file to be updated, foo.c and defs.h are the prerequisistes that foo.o depends on, and "cc -c -g foo.c" is the recipe that tells <code>make</code>
  how to update foo.o. <br>
  <br>
  A special type of target is the PHONY target. This is a target that <code>make</code> will only call when explicitly told to do so. The name of a phony target is not the
  name of a file but just a speical recipe name. An exmaple of a common phony target is the <code>clean</code> target, which typically deletes the created .o files from a 
  directory. Usually, there is no overalp between phony target names and the names of actual files, but in the case that overlap does occur simply set the name of the recipe
  as a prerequisite for the .PHONY special target.

  <pre>
    <code>
      .PHONY : clean <br>
      <br>
      clean : <br>
              rm *.o temp
    </code>
  </pre>

  <u>2. Implicit Rules</u><br>
  <code>make</code> can infer certain rules which find common use for remaking target files. An example would be creating a .o file form a .c file.
  <pre>
    <code>
      foo.o : foo.c 
    </code>
  </pre>

  In order to avoid using an implicit rule for a target that does not have a recipe simply give an empty recipe with a semicolon. <br>
  <br>
  It is also possible to change how implicit rules work by changing certain predefined variables and flags.
  <br>
  <br>
  <u>3. Variable Definitions</u><br>
  Variables can be defined in makefiles in two ways: <br>
  &#60;variable name&#62; &#61; &#60;string&#62; or &#60;variable name&#62; :&#61; &#60;string&#62; <br>
  <br>
  There is a slight difference between the two methods. The "&#61;" method is recursively expanded while the ":&#61;" method is simply expanded. The difference is in when the
  contents of the variable are expanded. Recursively expanded variables are expanded every time the variable is substituted while simply expanded variables are expanded once
  and only once. <br>
  <br>
  To use a variable in the makefile simply put $(&#60;variable name&#62;). Since variables in <code>make</code> work through strict textual substitution that means the text
  the variable is set equal to will be substituted in whenever the above is put. This is where the difference between recurisively expanded and simply expanded variables is seen. <br>
  <br>
  Variable names can include any character that is not "#", ":", "&#61;", or whitespace. <br>
  <br>
  An example of variable use is: <br>
  <pre>
    <code>
      objects = program.o foo.o utils.o <br>
      program : $(objects) <br>
             cc -o program $(objects) <br>
      <br>
      $(objects) : defs.h
    </code>
  </pre>
  In this example the variable "objects" is the string "program.o foo.o utils.o". Then the "objects" variable is used as the prerequisistes for the program target. Similarly,
  the example also shows that the files listed in the variable all have the prerequisiste file defs.h. <br>
  <br>
  <u>4. Directives</u><br>
  Directives are instructions for instructing <code>make</code> to do something special while reading the makefile. Example directives are conditionals, reading another makefile,
  or multiline variables. <br>
  <br>
  The exact syntax of a directive in the makefile depends on the directive in question. <br>
  <br>
  <u>Including Another Makefile</u><br>
  The directive to include another makefile is indicated as such: <br>
  <pre>
    <code>
      include &#60;filename&#62;
    </code>
  </pre>

  <code>make</code> allows for whitespaces at the beginning of the line but not tabs (or the character specified by .RECIPEPREFIX). If that character is seen then <code>make</code>
  will treat that line as a recipe. <br>
  <br>
  You can include variables in the filenames and when <code>make</code> see them it will expand those variables. <br>
  <br>
  To include multiple other makefiles simply separate the file names with whitespace. <br>
  <pre>
    <code>
      include &#60;filename 1&#62; &#60;filename 2&#62; ...
    </code>
  </pre>
  Another way to include other makefiles is through the variable MAKEFILES, but that will not be discussed in this manual. <br>
  <br>
  <u>Conditionals</u><br>
  Conditionals are a way to control what parts of a makefile are followed and which are not depending on specified values. <br>
  <br>
  The basic syntax for a conditional in <code>make</code> is below:
  <pre>
    <code>
      <i>Conditional Directive</i><br>
      <i>Text-if-True</i><br>
      endif
    </code>
  </pre>
  The syntax for more complex conditionals is below:
  <pre>
    <code>
      <i>Conditional Directive</i><br>
      <i>Text-if-True</i><br>
      else <br>
      <i>Text-if-False</i><br>
      endif
    </code>
  </pre>
  Or
  <pre>
    <code>
      <i>Conditional Directive</i><br>
      <i>Text-if-True</i><br>
      else <i>Conditional Directive Two</i><br>
      <i>Text-if-Two-True</i><br>
      endif
    </code>
  </pre>
  There can be as many <code>else <i>Conditional</i></code> segments as you wish. <br>
  <br>
  The <code>ifeq</code> directive tests if <code>arg1</code> and <code>arg2</code> are the same after variable expansion. There are five ways to use this directive. <br>
  <ol>
    <li><code>ifeq (arg1, arg2)</code></li>
    <li><code>ifeq "arg1", "arg2"</code></li>
    <li><code>ifeq 'arg1', 'arg2'</code></li>
    <li><code>ifeq "arg1", 'arg2'</code></li>
    <li><code>ifeq 'arg1', "arg2"</code></li>
  </ol>
  The same syntaxes apply for the <code>ifdef &#60;variable name&#62;</code> conditional directive. The input of the directive is a variable name and the directive checks if the variable's 
  value is non-empty. This directive also has a negative version <code>ifndef &#60;variable name&#62;</code>. If a variable has never been defined then it does not have a value. You can also 
  pass a function that expands to the name of the variable, which will then be checked. <br>
  <br>
  <u>5. Comments</u><br>
  Comments in makefiles function similarly to comments in typical programming languages. The comment, and the rest of the line that it appears on, is ignored by <code>make</code>. <br>
  <br>
  To start a comment use a "#" character. To have a comment run across multiple lines of the makefile follow the "#" character with a backslash and when you want to end the comment, escape it 
  with another backslash. If you want to use a literal "#" character then it must be preceded by a backslash, "\#". <br>
  <br>
  There are some instances where you are not allowed to use a comment. If a "#" occurs inside a variable or funciton name then it will be treated literally. Similarly, if you place a comment inside 
  of a recipe that line will be passed to the shell. That shell will then determine how to interpret that line. <br>
  <br>
  <h3><b>How to run <code>make</code>?</b></h3>
  To run <code>make</code> simply call the command <samp>make</samp> from the command line. Calling <samp>make</samp> without specifying a target causes <code>make</code> to use the default target.
  To call a specific <code>make</code> target simply write <samp>make</samp> and then the target's name. <br>
  <pre>
    <code>
      make
    </code>
  </pre>
  or
  <pre>
    <code>
      make clean # example of calling a specific target
    </code>
  </pre>
  For simplicity ensure that your makefile is called "makefile" or "Makefile". There are ways to change the name or use the other default options but these are the simplest.
